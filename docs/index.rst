Welcome to Scipion's documentation!
===================================
Scipion is an image processing framework for obtaining 3D models of
macromolecular complexes using Electron Microscopy (3DEM). It integrates
several software packages and presents a unified interface for both
biologists and developers. Scipion allows you to execute workflows
combining different software tools, while taking care of formats and
conversions. Additionally, all steps are tracked and can be reproduced
later on.
