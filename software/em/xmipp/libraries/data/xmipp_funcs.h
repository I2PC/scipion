 *  The I0 version can be tabulated and interpolated upon
 *  demand, but the max error needs to be checked.  The

 *  different from "v" corresponds to a change in units of x.
 *  In practice, it is often handy to replace x in some sort
 *  of absolute units with x described in terms of grid
 *  intervals.
 *
 *  The get_kbsinh_win and get_kbi0_win functions return
 *  single-argument function objects, which is what a

 * While for an estimation of time to go you can make it in two ways:  one
 * analytical, and another graphical.
 *
 * Analytical:
 *
 * @code
 * // Variable declaration
 * ProcessorTimeStamp t0;
 * double to_go;
 *
 * // Beginning of the program
 * time_config();
 * ...
 *
 * annotate_processor_time(&t0);
 * // Part to be measured
 * for (int i=0; i<60; i++)
 * {
 *     ...
 *     // Compute the time to go with the fraction of work already done
 *     to_go = time_to_go(t0, (double) (i + 1) / 60);
 *     std::cout << "I think you will be here " << to_go << "seconds more\n";
 * }
 * // End of part to be measured
 * print_elapsed_time(t0);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Alternatively:
 *
 * @code
 * // Variable declaration
 * TimeStamp t0;
 * double to_go;
 *
 * annotate_time(&t0);
 * // Part to be measured
 * for (int i=0; i<60; i++)
 * {
 *     ...
 *     // Compute the time to go with the fraction of work already done
 *     to_go = time_to_go(t0, (double) (i + 1) / 60);
 *     std::cout << "I think you will be here " << to_go << "seconds more\n";
 * }
 * // End of part to be measured
 * print_elapsed_time(t0);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Graphical:
 * @code
 * // Beginning of the program
 * time_config();
 * ...
 *
 * // Init the progress bar with the total amount of work to do
 * // It is very important that there is no print out to stdout but
 * // the progress bar
 * init_progress_bar(60);
 *
 * // Part to be measured
 * for (int i=0; i<60; i++)
 * {
 *     ...
 *     progress_bar(i+1);
 * }
 *
 * // In this case the following call is useless since it has been
 * // already done in the loop, but there are cases where a final call
 * // with the total amount of work is not performed and although the
 * // whole task has been finished it seems that it hasn't as the
 * // progress bar hasn't been called with the final work but with
 * // a quantity a little smaller.
 * progress_bar(60);

 * engine  and you will get tons of hits.) The following is from the CD
 * description:
 *
 * "This CDROM will contain 4.8 billion random bits. They were produced by a
 * combination of several of the best deterministic random number generators
 * (RNG's), together with three sources of white noise, as well as black noise
 * (from a rap music digital recording). My intent is to provide an unassailable
 * source for those who absolutely positively have to have a large, reliable set
 * of random numbers for serious simulation (Monte Carlo) studies."
