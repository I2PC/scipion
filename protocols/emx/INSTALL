emx is a pure python module, in order to install it create a directory named emx, copy to it all the files contained in this directory and modify the variable PYTHONPATH so it points towards the new created directory.

In order to modify the variable PYTHONPATH edit .bashrc or .tcshrc with commands to change PYTHONPATH. (not sure what shell your terminal is using? Run ‘echo $0′ That’s the number zero.)

For CSH shells, edit .cshrc and add a line like this:
setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:/path_to_the_emx_directory

For BASH shells, edit .bashrc and add something like these lines:
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path_to_the_emx_directory

The changes will take effect in newly opened terminals.
